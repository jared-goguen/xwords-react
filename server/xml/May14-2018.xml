    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>FIGHT CLUB! Now that was a movie that surprised and delighted me, in oddly unexpected ways. Acme plays on it today, hiding fighting words at the starts of phrases. KICK and PUNCH &hellip; them&#39;s fighting words!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Fight_Club_poster.jpg" style="border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:168px" title="First rule of FIGHT CLUB: no biting!" /></a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t groan. You knew I was going to say it.</p>

<p>BITE and SCRATCH weren&#39;t as apt for me, as they don&#39;t seem very FIGHT CLUB to me. Man, that movie was violent! BITE and SCRATCH seem more appropriate for a Three Stooges routine.</p>

<p>Of the themers, I liked PUNCH BOWL best, because it hides the meaning of PUNCH completely ... unless you&#39;re Tyler Durden, in which case you might actually punch a PUNCH BOWL. Talk about anger management issues.</p>

<p>KICKSTART also hid the KICK meaning a little, since &quot;kickstarting&quot; a project goes away from a kickstarter on a motorcycle. You do sort of kick a motorcycle&#39;s kickstarter, though.</p>

<p>BITE and SCRATCH don&#39;t hide their meanings at all within BITE VALVE and SCRATCH AND SNIFF. You literally bite a BITE VALVE in order to get water to throw. So again, I wasn&#39;t a fan of these two themer choices.</p>

<p>THROW is in the fill? I&#39;d have greatly preferred to keep it out, especially since THROW is much more Durden-esque than SCRATCH. (Hmm, THROW RUG?)</p>

<p>A couple of blips in the fill, noticeably ARTE, OBLA, OFA right off the top. I think the latter two could have been avoided by spacing out the themers more. Putting KICK START in row five (instead of row four) would have allowed for a couple of black squares separating BITE VALVE and KICK START, allowing them to play more nicely together.</p>

<p>EOSIN is such a toughie. Normally I don&#39;t classify anything as &quot;not Monday material&quot; &ndash; if the crossings are fair, what&#39;s the harm in forcing solvers to learn one new thing? But even having a pharma background, EOSIN feels like it could elicit a &quot;I have to know trivia to do crosswords?&quot; response from newbies. No bueno!</p>

<p>All in all, a good memory jog to a movie I enjoyed. Some missteps in execution, though.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p>This is the kind of puzzle that used to just need three long themers, but Will has challenged me to go for at least four including a reveal. This one has four PLUS a punchline. Lots of theme fill to get into a Monday.</p>

<p>I had never heard of a BITEWRENCH but I needed a BITE other than BITESIZED so it would have a different meaning for BITE. Proud it&#39;s not been used.</p>

<p>Recently went to hear David Mamet speak and he pointed out TSELIOT was an anagram of TOILETS. That was my takeaway from the Pulitzer Prize winner!<br />
(And appears as 38-Down)</p>]]></ConNotes>
