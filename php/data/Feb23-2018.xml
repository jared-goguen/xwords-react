    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>I love BJ NOVAK. He&#39;s an absolute genius! From writing for (and acting in) &quot;The Office,&quot; to a book of short stories, to <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/316868/the-book-with-no-pictures-by-bj-novak/9780803741713">the most hilarious (non-picture) picture book ever</a>, this guy is brilliant.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._J._Novak" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/B.J._Novak%2C_Actor.jpg/440px-B.J._Novak%2C_Actor.jpg" style="border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:250px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:206px" title="Dude is a genius!" /></a></p>

<p>Probably didn&#39;t do much for you if you didn&#39;t know him, though.</p>

<p>And Lovecraft&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_Cthulhu">&quot;The Call of CTHULHU&quot;</a>! Another masterpiece, this inducing terrors so horrifying that I can&#39;t begin to describe it without creeping myself out.</p>

<p>Again though, if you didn&#39;t know that, it wouldn&#39;t do much for you. Even worse, that bizarre letter sequence &ndash; something starting with CTHU, really? &ndash; might be aggravating. Annoying, even.</p>

<p>For me, this was a fantastic, A-1 themeless puzzle. Well crafted, with SUCH great use of mid-length slots &ndash; LUDDITE, GO GREEN, SWAGGER, MACH ONE, DAD JOKE, DNA LABS, ROSE CUT, XS AND OS, RISOTTO. Themeless constructors, take note!</p>

<p>THIS IS THE WAY YOU SHOULD BE USING MID-LENGTH SLOTS!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just be satisfied with having neutral filler in those precious seven-letter slots. Strive to use great material like this.</p>

<p>And CUE CARD is not just a excellent entry in its own right, but what a brilliant clue. At first (and at second and at third) glance, I had no idea what was going on. [Stage holdup?] didn&#39;t have anything to do with Old West robbers? No? A stage of a play? But how is a CUE CARD like a robbery?</p>

<p>*headslap*</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally held up (for actors&#39; benefit) on stage.</p>

<p>For me, POW! The gridsmanship is beautiful. But I can see how it wouldn&#39;t be POW! material for others. For that reason, I hesitated. I&#39;d guess that as NYT themelesses go, it might not be good &mdash; heck, it might even be bad, as it could turn off too many chunks of the solving population. Probably not a lot of intersection in the Venn diagram of BJ NOVAK and CTHULHU fans.</p>

<p>But hey, this is my award to give out, and I really enjoyed this puzzle. So there.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p>As I always look forward to the themeless puzzles each week, it&#39;s such a pleasure to be making my themeless debut today! I chose this grid in part for its pleasing symmetry, but also for its versatility. While it&#39;s true that there are no entries in the grid longer than 7 letters, the fact that there are 36 of these slots meant that I had a good amount of flexibility in placing my marquee answers. This 72-word grid also allowed me to incorporate some Scrabbly letters into lively entries without too much difficulty, and to maintain a nice grid flow throughout the puzzle while still being able to work on sections one at a time.</p>

<p>I started in the lower-left with CAPTCHA, which I found yielded promising letter combinations when paired with AMIRITE. The discovery that CTHULHU, another entry on my 7-letter seed list, could fit at 61-Across ended up being the key to finishing the corner, despite its delightfully odd combination of letters (not that I ever doubted the power of the Great Old One, mind you).</p>

<p>I did the upper-left next, seeing as ST JOHNS was one of my few choices for 24-Down. I was glad to be able to fit in DAD JOKE and NOXZEMA, as well as DNA LABS, which I think makes for a nice 1-Across, what with the interesting DN- start and Will and Joel&#39;s fantastic clue. Among other entries in the upper-right, I thought it would be cool to incorporate BJ NOVAK, in order to highlight both his great performance in The Office and the unusual opening letter sequence of BJN- (see a pattern here yet?) As it was the last to go in, filling the lower-right took the most time, but I&#39;m pleased with how it turned out, especially with the unexpected intersection of CAKE MIX and XS AND OS at the X.</p>

<p>AS I SAID, it&#39;s a joy to see this puzzle in the Times&mdash; though I&#39;ve since constructed several other themeless puzzles, this one might still be my favorite. Hope you enjoy solving it as much as I enjoyed creating it!</p>

<div style="text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px">P.S. Here&#39;s a bonus puzzle: purely by happenstance, one entry ended up in a particularly appropriate location &mdash; which one?</div>]]></ConNotes>
