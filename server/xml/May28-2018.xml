    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>So pleasant to start the week with a smiley face. Alex did a great job with his grid art, that grin coming right through, along with easily recognizable eyebrows. The black bars on the sides of the puzzle even look like rosy cheeks!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/SNice.svg/440px-SNice.svg.png" style="border:none; float:right; height:220px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px" title="How could anyone hate Mondays with a SMILE like this?" /></a></p>

<p>No?</p>

<p>Use your imagination, people!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the thinnish theme, as all three were grid-spanners, all three were apt, and there was excellent grid art. The theme left me FULL OF GOOD CHEER.</p>

<p>What did not was the fill. Even on Mondays, I think it&#39;s fine to give solvers something to learn. If you don&#39;t know PALAK paneer, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing, people!</p>

<p>But you can&#39;t cross that with DACHA, leaving a high chance that solvers will get that square wrong. I wouldn&#39;t blame them for complaining.</p>

<p>Similarly, see the AILERON / ALY crossing. Oof.</p>

<p>RECTO &hellip; this writer learned the term from crosswords. Not as tasty as PALAK, but hey, learning is good for you, right? At least the crossings felt fairer.</p>

<p>There&#39;s rarely a crossword that doesn&#39;t force constructors to make trade-offs. I understand why Alex decided to leave wide-open swaths of space all over the puzzle, as it made for beautiful grid art. However, the straightforward Monday theme wasn&#39;t served well by the fill that was so unfriendly to newer solvers. I would have much rather taken some compromises in the grid art, to produce a Monday-worthy fill.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p>Unlike most puzzles where the creative process begins with the theme and theme entries, this one started with the central grid art. Making grid art is a nice diversion from typical crossword construction activities, and every once in a while I experiment with different block configurations to try to create something puzzle worthy. Even moving just a couple of black squares by a single space can often completely change the resulting picture.</p>

<p>Once I had the basic smiling face in place, I went looking for appropriately happy 15-letter phrases to accompany it. Although three theme entries is a bit low for a themed puzzle these days, the constraints imposed by the grid art made that choice the most promising. Likewise, because I wanted the grid art to stand out, I chose to leave large areas of white space around the edges of the puzzle. I would have preferred to leave off even more of the black squares, but I couldn&#39;t get the grid to fill as cleanly without them.</p>

<p>For experienced solvers that breeze through Monday offerings, I hope they enjoyed uncovering the six non-thematic NYT crossword debuts (SCHOOL DANCE, CAPITAL DOME, SO CLOSE, POOL TOY, PALAK, and GROWL AT). I think that&#39;s the most non-thematic debut entries so far this year in a Monday puzzle.</p>

<p>Finally, I was particularly happy to position BREAK INTO A SMILE so that it &quot;breaks into&quot; the central smiling face. I hope at least a few solvers notice and appreciate this touch.</p>]]></ConNotes>
