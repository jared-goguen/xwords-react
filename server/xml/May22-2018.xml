    <JimNotes><![CDATA[Our <a href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Visual">Visual Puzzles</a> page collects grids you draw on. The earliest is <a href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=1/7/1996">this STAR rebus</a> from 1996.]]></JimNotes>
    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>Definitely check out the link Jim listed in his comment (below). That STAR rebus puzzle is stuck in my head, one of the cleverest of Sundays that got me hooked into the NY Times crossword.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dipper" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Ursa_Major_constellation_detail_map.PNG" style="border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:146px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px" title="See? Not all squished up." /></a></p>

<p>I liked seeing the concept again, although the impact was lessened for me since I remember that STAR rebus puzzle so vividly. The perils of having a long memory! I bet most solvers won&#39;t have seen it, and will thus have a much bigger a-ha moment.</p>

<p>The BIG DIPPER is part of URSA MAJOR, the GREAT BEAR? Wha ... ? Huh. Apparently, it is! How is it that I never knew this? (Probably because I spent most of my childhood watching &quot;Gilligan&#39;s Island.&quot; Fun fact, Mr. Howell&#39;s teddy bear was named Teddy.)</p>

<p>Jeff packs in a ton of thematic material, the NORTH STAR rounding things out. Now that one felt much more solid than URSA MAJOR. Yes, the BIG DIPPER seems to be a part of the GREAT BEAR, but that&#39;s more an incidental curiosity. I learned to find the NORTH STAR using the BIG DIPPER as a guide, linking them forever in my head.</p>

<p>I think I would have been happier with just BIG DIPPER and NORTH STAR, plus the visual. That would have also allowed for smoother fill, along with a more accurate representation of the BIG DIPPER. It looks kind of &hellip; skewed. Like it got shoved into a 15x15 box.</p>

<p>It may not seem so difficult to drop in seven extra letters to form the visual, but it&#39;s actually a (great) bear. So much flexibility taken away from that middle section, when you have to work around fixed letters! And if you shift a letter even one square, the visual starts to look all wonky. Not a surprise to get a bunch of odd entries in RONDEL, ORBIS, SERE, and a potentially lethal crossing in ESO BESO / ARABY. Oof.</p>

<p>A good concept even the second time around, and I understand the desire to toss in URSA MAJOR / GREAT BEAR to help bulk out the theme. It&#39;s a tough call &ndash; without them, some solvers might have considered the puzzle thin.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p>I had always wanted to try to make a picture puzzle, so I brainstormed images that could be done with a very small amount of dots to be connected. BIG DIPPER or LITTLE DIPPER was one of the first ideas I hit upon, though it was harder than you would think to get that asymmetric constellation positioned just right! I went with BIG DIPPER for the friendlier 9-letter count, along with its fellow 9-letter partners URSA MAJOR/GREAT BEAR.</p>

<p>I originally rounded it out with NORTH POLE, as in that&#39;s where you would always see the BIG DIPPER, but Will and Joel didn&#39;t think that was as strong a connection. Also, I had presented the themers in what I thought was a logical, sequential order (and all horizontal) but that presentation cluttered the grid, made for some yucky fill, and gave me triple black squares in the northwest and southwest corners.</p>

<p>Joel and Will suggested NORTH STAR, as in that&#39;s what the BIG DIPPER points to. That caused me to abandon the horizontal lineup and go to a pinwheel design of the grid, which improved the fill and cleaned up the blackness. I still had some ugly fill in the northwest until David Steinberg offered a very elegant solution of moving a couple of black squares.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m really curious to know from the solving community is how obvious the circles were as far as being in the shape of the Big Dipper in the unsolved grid. Since I started with that image, it always leapt out at me, but did others process it immediately? Our stargazing ancestors obviously picked this pattern out of the sky (twice!), so maybe it&#39;s hardwired in our brains regardless of whether it appears in a cluster of stars or a grid of squares!</p>]]></ConNotes>
