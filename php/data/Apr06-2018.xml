    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>I annoyed my Ultimate frisbee teammates so much back when &quot;The Office&quot; was on. (THAT&#39;S WHAT SHE SAID was Michael Scott&#39;s catch phrase, something to say after &quot;Looks like you&#39;re getting a big raise.&quot;) I grew out of that phase &hellip; well, I&#39;m still in it. My wife and I say it to each other! Nice triple-stack anchor, although I can see why Will put on a &quot;sophomoric&quot; qualifier in the clue.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Scott_(The_Office)" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/dc/MichaelScott.png" style="border:none; float:right; height:249px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:220px" title="THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! Yes, sophomoric. But funny." /></a></p>

<p>DO YOU WANT TO DANCE is a catchy song. It&#39;s too bad STAND IN GOOD STEAD is a little drier. Still, it&#39;s so tough to hit 3/3 snazzy long answers in a triple-stack.</p>

<p>Same goes for the top stack. HELICOPTER PARENT is evocative, as is A RUN FOR ONES MONEY. But don&#39;t most people call a DEPTH FINDER a DEPTH FINDER? Some research showed that SONIC DEPTH FINDER is indeed a real term, probably to distinguish it from other types of DEPTH FINDERs, I suppose?</p>

<p>Totally agreed with David, I appreciated LUNAR ROVER and EZ PASS LANE running through their stacks &ndash; those gave the puzzle more color. Triple-stack-focused puzzles often can be a bit dull outside the stacks, but these livened things up a lot.</p>

<p>WAR BABIES. &quot;A child born in wartime, especially one fathered by a serviceman.&quot; Not sure why this makes me uncomfortable. No doubt a colorful term. Not sure I&#39;d strive to use it in one of my own crosswords, though.</p>

<p>I thought I was going to be stumped in the west section. This mechanical engineer couldn&#39;t get his head around the idea that a SCREW was a [Thread holder]. I get that it was trying to misdirect toward some sort of spool. But I don&#39;t think the clue works without a question mark.</p>

<p>If only the question mark for the HELICOPTER PARENT had been moved to the SCREW clue. A HELICOPTER PARENT is pretty much exactly someone who cares too much, yeah? Why the qualifying &quot;?&quot;?</p>

<p>Screwy.</p>

<p>Not unusual to get a good glut of crossword glue holding triple-stacks together, TYRO ENDO PSF ENTR TOPE taping the top section alone. A few too many compromises for my taste overall, but still, enough color in the long entries to keep me satisfied.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p>This is the second themeless I&#39;ve constructed that features triple-stacked 16s (the first ran in <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D5/1/2015&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1522591816887000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjiqeX3ut1pwutPboa0P_xJ0CwXg" href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=5/1/2015" target="_blank">May 2015</a>). Since 15x16 and 16x15 grids have only recently become kosher, I have many fewer 16s than 15s in my word list (~5,000, as opposed to ~17,000). Finding stacks of 16s is thus significantly harder . . . but also more fun, I&#39;d say, since many of the 15s have been used SOO many times! I&#39;m looking at you, A LOT ON ONE&#39;S PLATE and A TEENAGER IN LOVE.</p>

<p>In this puzzle, I started with HELICOPTER PARENT on the top and THAT&#39;S WHAT SHE SAID on the bottom. My criteria when making 16-stacks (or any themeless stacks for that matter) are 1) snappy 16s, 2) smooth short fill, and 3) room to work in bonus long downs. I&#39;m especially happy with how I did on 3), since LUNAR ROVER, LEVIATHAN, REHYDRATE, and EZ-PASS LANE are all nice in my book! I also like the 16s&mdash;SONIC DEPTH FINDER is nothing to write home about, but I&#39;m proud of my clue for it. And as for the short fill, only ENTR, PSF, and ETDS stand out as clunky to me. All in all, I like how this one turned out, and I hope it&#39;s a fun solve! In any case, I&#39;ll be back on Sunday with my first solo diagramless.</p>]]></ConNotes>
