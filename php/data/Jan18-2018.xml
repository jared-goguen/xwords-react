    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>NO WAY = remove &quot;way&quot; from phrases for kooky results. The theme confused me a bit since RUN A TRAIN is something I see in some of my kids&#39; books. It&#39;s a bit kooky &hellip; but a bit real, too. And SUBSTATIONS is a real word, isn&#39;t it? (Yup.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_mixer" style="border:none"><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/CementMixerM2439.jpg/440px-CementMixerM2439.jpg" style="border:1px solid lightgray; float:left; height:144px; margin:6px 12px 6px 0px; width:220px" title="Turns out it's called a CONCRETE MIXER, not a CEMENT MIXER. Huh!" /></a></p>

<p>Thankfully, HIGH ROBBERY clarified the theme (more or less) for me. There&#39;s no such thing as HIGH ROBBERY! And I like me some heist movies like &quot;Tower Heist,&quot; especially when they happen up on rooves. So that worked for me.</p>

<p>ONE STREET &hellip; not kooky enough for me.</p>

<p>But I did love some of the fill. RIGHT-O! The GEM STATE shone. (*rimshot*) A LONDONER next to a STOCKADE painted a funny 17th-century picture. And CEMENT MIXER was fantastic!</p>

<p>Er, CEMENT MASON. Hmm. I so badly wanted it to be CEMENT MIXER. Such a great clue, riffing on &quot;concrete plans.&quot; Let&#39;s just pretend it was the much more awesome CEMENT MIXER, shall we?</p>

<p>Overall, mixed results, especially given my high expectations for creativity on my Thursday puzzles. What other, more surprising WAY removals are there? WAYNE NEWTON to NE (Nebraska) NEWTON? PROJECT RUNWAY to PROJECT RUN? It turns out to be a tough trigram to work with. Huh.</p>

<p>I did appreciate much of the gridwork, not bad at all to finish up with just some ignorable stuff in a debut puzzle. Let&#39;s just try not to eke (ha) out so much similar ETE, ERE, ENE stuff next time.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p><strong>RYAN:</strong> Alan and I met in college where we sang in several groups together, notably in our a cappella group the Princeton Nassoons. He was actually the person who first got me interested in crossword puzzles! After graduating we decided it would be fun to collaborate and create a puzzle together.</p>

<p>Alan came up with the theme idea for this one, and we worked together to manually fill the grid and create clues. Based on the theme, we had clued this around Tuesday/Wednesday difficulty, though the NYT team accepted it for a Thursday and many of the clues were adjusted to be more challenging.</p>

<p>Looking back it would have been nice to get a couple juicier longer down answers in the NE and SW, and perhaps some better short fill, although I liked how they used some atypical clues for a few (ONO, ERE, ANO). Nevertheless, the puzzle was fun to make together, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>

<p><strong>ALAN:</strong> Very excited to be my making my NYT Crossword debut today! A bit about me: I&#39;m a 25-year-old energy market consultant/singer-songwriter/marathoner living in New York City. I found my way into the crossword community through a lifelong love of word games and puzzles (I grew up playing Scrabble and Boggle with my mom and solving Sudoku and Ken Ken before bed) but didn&#39;t really get into crosswords until college, where I met my collaborator, Ryan McCarty. Ryan and I were members of the Princeton University Glee Club and the Princeton Nassoons, the university&#39;s oldest a cappella group, before beginning our crossword collaboration.</p>

<p>For today&#39;s puzzle, I started writing down crossword theme ideas in the &quot;Notes&quot; app on my phone during my commutes to work in 2015. Many of the early concepts I came up with revolved around phrases that lent themselves to literal interpretations involving a letter addition or removal (&quot;DROP THE F&quot; BOMB luckily never came to fruition&hellip;).</p>

<p>But then NO WAY came to me and I realized dropping an entire word might result in some fresher &quot;wacky&quot; phrases. RUN A TRAIN was the first potential theme answer that I thought of, and with Ryan&#39;s expert grid construction skills and some more theme answer brainstorming, I knew we were on the right track, so to speak.</p>

<p>Side note: as a runner, I was excited to use &quot;Marathon leader?&quot; as the clue for ULTRA, but I wasn&#39;t sure if the Ultramarathon reference was too obscure for the general public. After a quick Google search eased my initial worries, I noticed the following blurb in the Wikipedia article for Ultramarathon:</p>

<p>Since 1997, runners have been competing in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Transcendence_3100_Mile_Race&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1516117165977000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHYxArNbsYRImQ1O3cPxmBunHCaA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Transcendence_3100_Mile_Race">Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race</a>, which is billed as the longest official footrace in the world. They run 100 laps a day for up to 50 days around a single block in Queens, NY, for a total distance of 3,100 miles (5,000 km)</p>

<p>This absurd race has been the topic of many conversations since finding out about it during my crossword research. Just thinking about the fact that Suprabha Beckjord ran the race 14 times (i.e., she spent over two years of her life running around a high school in Queens) makes my legs hurt...</p>]]></ConNotes>
