    <JimNotes><![CDATA[Counting Variety puzzles, this is crossword #24 for Sam, and he won't be 23 years old until later this month. David is only 21 and this is his puzzle #80.]]></JimNotes>
    <JeffNotes><![CDATA[<p>This is a good example of why themelesses featuring seven-letter entries can be so tough to construct. It might seem like it should be just as easy to make a seven-letter entry sing, as compared to even an eight-letter one. But wow is it tough!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" s_adventures_of_the_gummi_bears=""><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9d/Gummibears.jpg" style="border:1px solid lightgray; float:right; height:165px; margin:6px 0px 6px 12px; width:219px" title="Why on earth did I like this show so much?" /></a></p>

<p>Not only are there fewer letters to work with, producing fewer word / phrase combinations, but crosswords in general use seven-letter filler more often than longer stuff. That means that we regular solvers tend to see the same seven-letter entries relatively often, making them feel not as fresh as they once were. I HEAR YA is fun. But now that it&#39;s been used a bunch of times in the NYT, it&#39;s not as interesting to me.</p>

<p>Compare to GUMMY BEAR (debut) or IVORY SOAP (only one previous usage). Although IVORY SOAP isn&#39;t as fun as GUMMY BEAR to me, they&#39;re both neat entries that I don&#39;t see often.</p>

<p>All that said, I did like a lot of the seven-letter fill. BIG TIME, SMALL OJ, TOP TIER, even SOUPS UP are great phrases. And even a couple of strong single-worders in LACONIC, PAISANO and the devilish-sounding BILIOUS.</p>

<p>Such a fantastic clue in [It&#39;s found between the shoulders]. Yes, a HIGHWAY is between two shoulders! Wait. It&#39;s ROADWAY? What&#39;s a ROADWAY, you ask?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a road?</p>

<p>Humph.</p>

<p>I liked David and Sam&#39;s efforts to spice up the grid by using a few headlining long entries. GUMMY BEAR was great, reminding me of my childhood and that annoyingly catching theme song from the GUMMY BEARs TV show (do yourself a favor and don&#39;t YouTube it).</p>

<p>SNIPER RIFLE had the opposite effect for me, given what&#39;s going on with school shootings. I know it&#39;s not exactly related, and the clue was great &ndash; &quot;far-sighted&quot; indeed! &ndash; but kind of a downer of an entry.</p>

<p>Solid work, if not a standout for me.</p>]]></JeffNotes>
    <ConNotes><![CDATA[<p><strong>DAVID:</strong> Sam and I often joke about how my themelesses are always Fridays while his are always Saturdays. Since this puzzle ended up on a Friday, my style *clearly* dominated! Just kidding&mdash;as with most of our collaborations, the effort was very much 50/50. I don&#39;t remember much about the construction process, but I think we started with Sam&#39;s zippy SPIN A WEB/SMALL OJ/PTA MEETINGS corner. Once we had the upper left in place, we knew we were onto something. Overall, I&#39;m happy with the balance between smoothness and lively fill in this one. Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>SAM:</strong> Always an honor to work with one of the #GOATs of the cross-world. David is now a full-time puzzle editor while still swamped with schoolwork at Stanford ... I really don&#39;t know how he does it. And, of course, let&#39;s not forget that every last puzzle he makes is top-notch!</p>

<p>This puzzle collected a bit of dust, as David and I both have enough on file individually that this needed to be staggered out. I believe we made it around the same time as our <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date%3D3/25/2017&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1525836850253000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNEc0RemfEbE7JQtkoKcTfb3xIIg" href="https://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=3/25/2017" target="_blank">LIFE OF PABLO themeless</a>, which ran the weekend of the 2017 A.C.P.T.! David is correct that I anchored the grid with SPIN A WEB ... but that was only after he gave my original NW corner a beautiful makeover to what you see now. You can tell that the SE corner is his as well, since it&#39;s silky smooth and still quite lively.</p>

<p>Lately, I&#39;ve grown to realize how much a good clue can elevate an otherwise normal answer. Take David&#39;s clues for ROADWAY and STIFFED; just like that, those answers now feel like highlights in a grid. I think our clue for I HEAR YA (one of my personal favorites ever, might I add) makes that whole corner feel zippier. Even the &quot;Jarhead&quot; reference in the GULF WAR clue provides nice variety without seeming too arcane, as not everything needs to be wordplay-dependent. Would love to hear solvers&#39; ideas on this.</p>

<p>As David said, enjoy our latest published collab! Hope none of you fell for JELLY BEAN with that ????Y BEA? pattern ...</p>]]></ConNotes>
